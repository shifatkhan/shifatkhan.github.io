				The Departement of CompSci, DCS, is home to internationally-recognized faculty and students. Faculty in DCS have been presented with
				a wide variety of honours and awards over the years, including the Turing Award (the "Nobel Prize" of Computer
				Science), and many other international and national honors. Our faculty and graduate students consistently 
				produce high-impact research that is among the most highly cited in computer science and attracts attention far
				beyond the discipline. Our students, both graduate and undergraduate, excel on the national and international stages.
				For instance, DCS has been awarded more Canada Graduate Scholarships, the country's most prestigious graduate
				fellowship, than any other computer science department in Canada.

			<h2>To give you an idea:</h2>
			
			<p>
				<b>Computer Systems</b> <br/>
				"Software systems are complex and interesting. Poorly done systems can be incredibly expensive: they can cost<br/>
				society billions of dollars, and sometimes make the difference between life and death. Rapid changes in<br/>
				technology and applications means that the underlying systems must continually adapt. This focus takes you<br/>
				under the covers of software systems, laying bare the layers and introducing you to concurrency issues,<br/>
				scalability, multiprocessor systems, distributed computing, and more."
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Web and Internet Technologies</b><br/>
				"The Web and Internet Technologies Focus introduces students to the systems and algorithms that power <br/>
				today's large-scale web and Internet applications such as search engines, social networking applications,<br/>
				web data mining applications, and content distribution networks. The focus covers both the algorithm<br/>
				foundations of Web and Internet Technologies, as well as the implementation and system architecture.<br/>
				Students who wish to pursue the Web and Internet Technologies focus should have a solid understanding <br/>
				of statistics, should be good programmers and have a good understanding of data structures and algorithm<br/>
				design.<br/>
				To get practical experience, students pursuing the web and Internet technologies concentration are<br/>
				encouraged to do either a term project or a summer USRA carrying out a project in web and internet <br/>
				technologies."
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Game Design</b> <br/>
				"Video game design combines several disciplines within computer science, including software engineering,<br/>
				graphics, artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. It also incorporates elements of<br/>
				economics, psychology, music and creative writing, requiring video game researchers to have a diverse,<br/>
				multidisciplinary set of skills.<br/>
				Students who wish to pursue video game design should have an understanding of linear algebra (for <br/>
				computer graphics modeling), computer hardware and operating systems (for console architecture), data <br/>
				structures, and algorithm design. Students will gain a general knowledge of the more advanced topics<br/>
				listed in the courses below."
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Artificial Intelligence</b>
				Artificial Intelligence (AI) is aimed at understanding and replicating the computational processes <br/>
				underlying intelligent behaviour. These behaviours include the perception of one's environment, learning<br/>
				how that environment is structured, communicating with other agents, and reasoning to guide one's actions.<br/>
				This concentration is designed to provide students with an introduction to some of the key scientific and<br/>
				technical ideas that have been developed in AI. There are four different sub-areas of AI represented in<br/>
				our department: Computer Vision, Computational Linguistics (CL), Machine Learning (ML), and Knowledge <br/>
				Representation and Reasoning (KR). These areas cover a wide variety of ideas and techniques. Students <br/>
				wanting to achieve this concentration are required to take courses from at least two of these sub-areas.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Scientific Computing</b> <br/>
				"Scientific computing studies the world around us. Known and unknown quantities are related through  <br/>
				certain rules, e.g. physical laws, formulating mathematical problems. These problems are solved by  <br/>
				numerical methods implemented as algorithms and run on computers. The numerical methods are analyzed  <br/>
				and their performance (e.g. accuracy, efficiency) studied. Problems, such as choosing the optimal shape <br/>
				for an airplane (to achieve, for example, minimal fuel consumption), finding the fair price for derivative <br/>
				products of the market, or regulating the amount of radiation in medical scans, can be modeled by  <br/>
				mathematical expressions, and solved by numerical techniques. <br/>
				Students wishing to study scientific computing should have a strong background in mathematics, in particular <br/>
				calculus of several variables, linear algebra and statistics, be fluent in programming, and have a good <br/>
				understanding of data structures and algorithm design."
