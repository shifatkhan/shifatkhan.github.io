			<p>
				Queen's has great academic reputation. But that's about it. Their campus is in pretty bad condition with old building
				almost falling apart. The teachers aren't the best, almost irreproachable. It's like if they're looking at the students
				as if they're numbers. That said, there are some of them who are great teachers. The students are very sociable. They 
				need to work on their maintenance more to become a perfect University.

			<h2>To give you an idea:</h2>
			
			<p>
				<b>Biomedical Computing</b> <br/>
				"Combines a strong Computing and Math component, foundational courses in the life sciences (Biology, Biochemistry, <br/>
				and Microbiology), and specialized courses in Computational Biology, Computer-Integrated Surgery, and Medical  <br/>
				Informatics (105 core units plus 15 elective units)." <br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Courses you'll encounter:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Introductory Biology of Cells</li>
					<li>General Chemistry</li>
					<li>Introduction to Computing Science</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<img class="left" src="./images/queen-lab.jpg" alt="CeLab at Queen's">
			
			<p>
				<b>Game Development</b> <br/>
				"According to the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, the 348 companies that make up the game  <br/>
				industry in Canada employ over 16000 people, and have $1.7 billion direct economic impact. Growth over the  <br/>
				last two years has been 11% and projected growth over the next two years is 17%. Leading companies in <br/>
				Canada include Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft Canada, Nintendo of Canada, Sony <br/>
				Computer Entertainment, and Disney Interactive Studios. According to industry spokesmen, intense labour <br/>
				competition is making experienced staff harder to find, and (when found) to retain, and that the  <br/>
				post-secondary education system is not producing graduates in sufficient numbers or with skills that meet <br/>
				industry expectations."
			</p>
			<p>
				Courses you'll encounter:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>General Physics</li>
					<li>Game Design</li>
					<li>Scientific Computing</li>
					<li>etc.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Software Design</b> <br/>
				"S variant that focuses on software design and development; it has been accredited by CIPS according to<br/>
				their more stringent Software Engineering criteria as well as their Computer Science criteria. There are <br/>
				now two options within SODE: a general Software Development option and a specialized option in Game Development."<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				Courses you'll encounter:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Introduction to Computing Science</li>
					<li>Linear Algebra</li>
					<li>Logic for Computing Science</li>
					<li>etc.</li>
				</ul>
