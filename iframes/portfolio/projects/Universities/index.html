				Here, we will guide you through various universities so you can find which university 
				is best suited for you.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				First, if you continue in this field, you need to be patient with your studies and don't
				get too frustrated if you are stuck on one part of a programming assignment or confused
				about a concept. Struggling with the materials is a normal and essential part of the 
				learning process. You're probably better off going through the course sequentially and 
				consulting external references as needed. Each lesson, particularly in the programming 
				component of the course, builds on previous sections and it is best to keep up with the 
				materials throughout. You're welcome to go at your own pace and begin or end at any time.

			<h2>Don't feel like coding anymore? Well, here's some reasons to motivate you!</h2>
			<p class="left">
				<b>Computer Science is part of everything we do!</b> <br/>
				Computing and computer technology are part of just about everything that touches our <br/>
				lives from the cars we drive, to the movies we watch, to the ways businesses and governments <br/>
				deal with us. Understanding different dimensions of computing is part of the necessary skill <br/>
				set for an educated person in the 21st century. Whether you want to be a scientist, develop the<br/>
				latest killer application, or just know what it really means when someone says "the computer made<br/>
				a mistake", studying computing will provide you with valuable knowledge.
			</p>
			
			<p class="left">
				<b>Computing gets you paid!</b> <br/>
				Computing jobs are among the highest paid and have the highest job satisfaction. Computing is <br/>
				very often associated with innovation, and developments in computing tend to drive it. This,<br/>
				in turn, is the key to national competitiveness. The possibilities for future developments are <br/>
				expected to be even greater than they have been in the past.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>
				<b>No boundaries for future opportunities!</b> <br/>
				Computing is one of those fields where it is almost impossible to predict what will happen next. This<br/>
				is why we cannot even begin to imagine all the ways that you can make a contribution to it and it can <br/>
				make your life's work exciting and real.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Computer Science will never die!</b> <br/>
				There actually are more computing jobs than qualified people to fill them in the United States. The Bureau<br/>
				of Labor Statistics projects growth rates between 12% and 37% in computing and information technology occupations<br/>
				from 2012 through 2022. If you consider the expected growth in computing, it's easy to see that companies <br/>
				simply need more talent. Don't miss out on pursuing the large number of open positions available right now.
