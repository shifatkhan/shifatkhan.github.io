			<p>
				Concordia offers a very cool environment in their campus. If you don't mind making friends,
				this university has the perfect atmosphere to make many, which is perfect for Computer Science students.
			</p>
			
			<h2>To give you an idea:</h2>
			
			<p>
				<b>Software Systems</b> <br/>
				"Build compilers, operating systems and communications software that developers use to create applications.<br/>
				In other words, software systems specialists develop the tools that are used by just about everyone else in<br/>
				the computer science or engineering fields. When you study software systems, you'll learn how to design the <br/>
				software you see (the application) and the software you don't see (the operating system) and how to get them <br/>
				to work together."
			</p>
			<p>
				In their labs, lectures and projects, you will:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Define the properties and requirements of software systems that cross multiple application domains.</li>
					<li>Develop data structures and algorithms that put abstract ideas into practice.</li>
					<li>Profile, debug, and optimize large software applications.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<img class="left" src="./images/web-design.jpg" alt="Cellphone with pictures">
			
			<p>
				<b>Web Services & Applicaitons</b> <br/>
				"Study web services and applications and you'll learn to revolutionize online banking or create the next <br/>
				revolution in social media applications - the possibilities are limitless. As a computer scientist, you'll have<br/>
				expert knowledge of the interconnectivity between databases, communications networks and information retrieval <br/>
				to create online applications and services."
			</p>
			<p>
				In their labs, lectures and projects, you will:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Design web-centric applications that provide intuitive customer-oriented services.</li>
					<li>Develop distributed software systems that scale to meet the demands of contemporary organizations.</li>
					<li>Investigate opportunities for the deployment of applications across multiple hardware devices and platforms.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<img class="right" src="./images/video-games.jpg" alt="Gamers">
			<p>
				<b>Computer Games</b> <br/>
				"If you're a gamer, you know how video games look from the outside. When you study Computer Games, you'll learn<br/> 
				to create games from the inside out. You'll explore the relationships between graphics, game design, physics <br/>
				simulation, programming, artificial intelligence and player interfaces. As a computer scientist, you'll have the<br/>
				expertise to fit those pieces together into an interactive experience."
			</p>
			<p>
				In their labs, lectures and projects, you will:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Represent graphical entities in 2D and 3D environments.</li>
					<li>Design sophisticated computer games, with control over character movement, path finding, and world representation.</li>
					<li>Integrate AI methods into the gaming process.</li>
				</ul>
